# Welcome!

My name is Liam Nestelroad and I am currently A DecSecOps Engineer with Lockheed Martin. I studied Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder and graduated in 2021. With the void in my life left behind by college, I am filling it with a slew of half baked personal projects and code! Please feel free to peruse and judge my attempts to create.
