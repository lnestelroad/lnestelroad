# Welcome!

My name is Liam Nestelroad and I am currently A DecSecOps Engineer with Lockheed Martin. I studied Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder and graduated in 2021. With the void in my life left behind by college, I am filling it with a slew of half baked personal projects and code! Please feel free to peruse and judge my attempts to create. Also, check out some of my deployed works including sites to my blog and start up business Crebain Consulting LLC.
